e26807c Added todays changelog
f36b2e6 Battery Friend: Fix dynamic fsync
b8d8663 Battery Friend: Fix typo
2c82f24 Battery Friend: Don't allow hotplug during device is active
cbd4cbe Battery Friend: CPUFREQ: Added early suspend
115d3a3 Battery Friend: Resort some options
b7dd4df [PATCH, v9] cgroups: introduce timer slack controller Changelog:
bb364be dpll44xx: Set pr_info active for debugging
0873389 Battery Friend: Fix accidently wrong definition The old config was controlled by an extra option. I forgot to remove/rename it - that's why early suspend didn't work for CPU
d3942f3 Disable Intellidemand
abbf610 Battery Friend: Fix missing rule definitions
9671f4b Battery Friend: Move needed functions for governor change to early suspend area
401ebb2 Battery Friend: Extended with dynamic hotplug function. When Battery Friend is ON it will always turn OFF CPU1 during suspend (screen off) - but it will never allow to turn off CPU1 during active state (screen on). The code also protects against conflicts between using battery friend + a hotplug governor (which isn't a goot idea though). When Battery Friend is disabled the governor will be switched to hotplug during suspend and the prior governor will be restored on resum.
c9290c1 Battery Friend: Change the gamma rule for generic change of gamma value
312c680 Battery Friend: Fix gamma value lock
51dcffc Battery Friend: Add missing register
17d24c9 Cleanup and fixes from last few commits
8c977fc Fix SIOPLUS tuning, remove zzmoove governor for now - must be fixed for 3.0.8 hybrid - add Lazy gov again including new feature SmoothUI.

90b4442 mm: vmscan: remove unimplemented above_background_load
9ab8baf When reading from large files through the generic file read functions into page cache we can detect when a file is so large that it is unlikely to be fully cached in ram. If that happens we can put it on the tail end of the inactive lru list so it can be the first thing evicted next time we need ram.
b0ed8eb Add a background scanning timer to restore the watermarks to the pages_lots level and only call on it if kswapd has not been called upon for the last 5 seconds. This allows us to balance all zones to the more generous pages_lots watermark at a time unrelated to page allocation thus leading to lighter levels of vm load when called upon under page allocation.
ac70589 When kswapd is awoken due to reclaim by a running task, set the priority of kswapd to that of the calling task thus making memory reclaim cpu activity affected by nice level.
d13d7be While it may be nice to have a copy of pages on swap once written there, the more garbage we leave in the swapspace the slower any further writes and reads to and from it are. Just free swapcache whenever we can.
9cc1bbc Swap Token: Only allow its effect when swap is half full. It's only useful for conditions of swap trash
6185738 Swappiness: Set to 10 - Never seen a desk which benefits from a high swappiness, but setting to 0 can cause weird behavior. Set it to 10.
